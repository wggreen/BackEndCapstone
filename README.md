# Hit The Road

Hit The Road is a travel-planning and messaging web app for bands looking to book tours and music venues looking to better manage booking inquiries.
I have a lot of friends who are musicians, and the one thing they agreed could be improved with technology is the process of booking a tour.
My friends who run music venues also said the booking inquiry process could desperately use some standardization and centralization.
